# Shimano BT-E6000 BMS PCB

My old Shimano BT-E6000 battery gave up on me a couple of years back and I always wanted to check out what killed it. I did not get around to do that and seeing a custom IC on the back of the PCB I got to tracing the hole pcb to try and figure out how it all ticks.

Right now I traced most of it, and the KiCAD project contains a messy schematic file. I hope to continue my work on it, but I wanted to put what I've done on here if I lose interest and perhaps to catch some of the mistakes I've made.
